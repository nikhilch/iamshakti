Starting with your favorite bash terminal, run the following commands:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/nikhilch/iamshakti.git`
1. Go in the repo: `cd iamshakti`
1. Create a virtual environment: `virtualenv shakti-venv`
1. Get virtual: `source shakti-venv/bin/activate`
1. Install dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. Get the secret file from Nikhil


### The Juicy Stuff

While in the `shakti-venv` virtual environment, run `python3 manage.py runserver` and point your browser to <http://localhost:8000/iamshakti/>.
